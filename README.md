### My projects I'm currently working on (public repos only):
> I'm currently quite busy with life and private projects. Sorry (~May 2025)

[EDLA-rs](https://github.com/0Akise/edla-rs): A Rust project to revive ED(Error Diffusion) for ML. I personally believe that BP/GD is very "wrong" and extremely inefficient. Also, they disrespect actual biological aspects.

[Orbis](https://github.com/0Akise/Orbis): A C++20 project based on SFML3. A header-only UI library focused on ease of use.
